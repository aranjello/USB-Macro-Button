          <figcaption> Here is an example that uses all of the extra functionality together to type out an emoji smiley face on windows. When the GUI button and . are pressed on windows a menu pops up to allow emojis to be input into any text box. We press the requried buttons and then release them. We need to delay for just a second so that windows can open the menu and get ready(this may be longer or shorter on your system and you may need to experiment). after the dealy we change the mode so that we can type out each character one after another and then press eneter. The result of this is that when we have our cursoer in any text box we can press the button to instanly add in an emoji.</figcaption>
